# SESSIONS — running log

## The plan we're following
**Bible §8 Slice 0** — one seeded, scripted, headless run that inspects a row,
escalates on injected faults, writes verdicts back onto USD panels, and drops a
run record; orchestration covered by Isaac-free tests. It splits in two:
- **Brain half (pure-python, no Spark):** schema contract, the 3 interfaces
  (Perception/Transport/RobotControl), the escalation FSM, `FakeSimBackend`,
  configs, `run.py`, tests. → **Buildable + testable right here.**
- **World half (Isaac-bound, on the Spark):** `world/farm_builder.py`,
  `world/sim_runtime.py`, `transport/sim_native.py`, `transport/ros2_bridge.py`,
  plus the Day-1 ROS 2 de-risk. → **User runs on the Spark.**

## 2026-07-21 — Session 1: Brain spine built end-to-end ✅
**Done (all pure-python, no Isaac; 31 pytest tests green):**
- `pyproject.toml` (pure-python deps only), package tree + `__init__`s.
- `schema/pv_module.py` — fault taxonomy (§6.5), `PanelRecord`, `pv:` attr
  constants, append-only log, `local_to_geo`/`geo_to_local` georef.
  **pxr imported lazily inside the USD fns only** so the module imports Isaac-free.
- Interfaces: `perception/base.py` (Verdict/Diagnosis), `transport/base.py`
  (Pose + panel read/write), `control/base.py` (Waypoint).
- `perception/ground_truth.py` — the Slice 0 "cheat": reads `pv:state` from ctx.
- `orchestrator/mission.py` — the escalation FSM (ADVANCE→SCREEN→CONFIRM→
  WRITEBACK), returns structured `MissionResult` (injected-vs-detected, events).
- `orchestrator/fake_backend.py` — `FakeSimBackend` (Transport+RobotControl in
  RAM) for Isaac-free logic tests.
- `world/layout.py` — pure geometry + **seeded** fault injection; shared by
  `run.py` now and `farm_builder.py` later so sim & tests get identical panels.
- `configs/farm.yaml`, `configs/mission.yaml` (seeded, sim_native default).
- `run.py` — config → mission → `runs/<ts>/results.json`. `--backend fake`
  works now; `--backend sim_native` raises a clear NotImplemented (Spark half).
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` — platform + how-to-run + ROS 2 TODO.
- **Verified run:** `--backend fake` → 10 panels, 2 seeded faults, detection_rate
  1.00, run record emitted.

**Key finding:** `usd-core` has **no aarch64 wheel** → `pxr` only exists under
Isaac's Python on this box. Drove the lazy-pxr design in `pv_module.py`. See
`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

**Decisions:** sim-native is the only Transport until Day-1 ROS 2 check (user
confirmed ROS 2 status = not yet checked). Plain FSM (not py_trees). Fault
subset healthy/hotspot/soiled. 0-based row/col indices in panel IDs.

**Next (World half, on the Spark, in Bible §8 order):**
1. **Day 1-2:** ROS 2 camera-publish de-risk; record result + build details in
   `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` (the `[ ]` checklist there).
2. **Day 3-5:** `world/farm_builder.py` — build USD from `farm.yaml` reusing
   `world/layout.py`; stamp `PVModule` prims via `schema` USD fns; assert Z-up/
   meters; inject faults + emissive signature + semantics.
3. **Day 6-8:** `world/sim_runtime.py` + `transport/sim_native.py` (annotator/
   render-product camera reads + poses); kinematic `control/kinematic.py`.
4. Wire `sim_native` into `run._build_backend`; run the real mission on Spark.
5. `transport/ros2_bridge.py` per §6.3 (only depend on it once Day-1 passes).

**Not started:** everything World-half above; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/ROS2_CONTRACT.md`; git branch/commit (nothing committed yet this session).
