## The plan we're following
**Bible §8 Slice 0** — one seeded, scripted, headless run that inspects a row,
escalates on injected faults, writes verdicts back onto USD panels, and drops a
run record; orchestration covered by Isaac-free tests. It splits in two:
- **Brain half (pure-python, no Spark):** schema contract, the 3 interfaces
  (Perception/Transport/RobotControl), the escalation FSM, `FakeSimBackend`,
  configs, `run.py`, tests. → **Buildable + testable right here.**
- **World half (Isaac-bound, on the Spark):** `world/farm_builder.py`,
  `world/sim_runtime.py`, `transport/sim_native.py`, `transport/ros2_bridge.py`,
  plus the Day-1 ROS 2 de-risk. → **User runs on the Spark.**

---

## 2026-07-21 — Session 2: Day-1 de-risk + ROS 2 install
**Environment verified on the Spark (see `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`):**
- aarch64 · CUDA **13.0** · GB10 · Isaac Sim **6.0.1-rc.7** (⚠ NOT 5.1 — verify
  APIs vs 6.0) · `python.sh` at `IsaacSim/_build/linux-aarch64/release/`.
- **ROS 2 was absent** (no `/opt/ros`). Ubuntu **24.04 noble** → **Jazzy** is the
  match, and Isaac 6.0's bridge bundles `jazzy` + `humble` internal libs.
- Isaac Sim **not running** (live MCP refused) → sandbox render proof still TODO.
- Local **Qwen2.5-VL-72B** vLLM on `:8000` (future `cosmos_reason.py` backend).

**Actions:**
- Wrote `plan.md` (divided workstreams A–F + Day-1 checklist).
- User granted passwordless sudo (Option B, `/etc/sudoers.d/99-simulationhub-nopasswd`).
- Wrote `tools/install_ros2_jazzy.sh`; installing **ros-jazzy-desktop + ros-dev-tools**.
- **Lesson / near-miss:** first script version had `apt-get upgrade -y` → started a
  359-pkg full-system upgrade (CUDA/nvidia/docker/systemd). Aborted in the
  download phase (nothing installed; dpkg clean). Removed the upgrade line —
  never blanket-upgrade this production box.
- Committed Brain spine to branch `slice0-brain-spine`, pushed to origin
  (`github.com/dhird6/solar_twin`). PR: /pull/new/slice0-brain-spine.

**Env change — vLLM stopped (2026-07-21):** the `Qwen2.5-VL-72B` vLLM
(`vllm.service`, was auto-restarting, held ~70% GPU) is **stopped + disabled +
unit moved aside** to free the GB10 for Isaac Sim. Unit backed up at
`/etc/systemd/system/vllm.service.disabled-by-claude-20260721`. Restore:
`sudo mv .../vllm.service.disabled-by-claude-20260721 /etc/systemd/system/vllm.service && sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now vllm.service`.
(Was the intended `cosmos_reason.py` backend — bring it back before that work.)

**Day-1 COMPLETE ✅ (camera→ROS 2 verified):** installed ROS 2 Jazzy (ros-base;
desktop conflicts with system python3-paraview) — `ros2 doctor` 5/5. Launched
Isaac Sim **6.0.1** (build `045ca8b`) headless via `tools/day1_ros2_camera_check.py`
(self-contained scene, no asset download), bridge `isaacsim.ros2.bridge-5.1.2`.
Verified from a sourced Jazzy shell: `/rgb` + `/camera_info` in `topic list`,
`/rgb` at **~50 Hz**, `/camera_info` echoes 640x480 + K matrix. **The feared Spark
ROS-2 sensor quirk does NOT affect this build** → ROS 2 is a viable Transport;
`ros2_bridge.py` can be real, not a stub (Slice 0 still defaults sim-native).
Sim stopped after; GPU free. Details in `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

**Next:** Workstream B — `world/farm_builder.py` (build the USD farm from
`farm.yaml`, reuse `world/layout.py`, stamp PVModule prims). Then WS-C sim_runtime
+ sim_native transport. Optionally capture PyTorch cu13 version from Isaac python.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 1: Brain spine built end-to-end ✅
**Done (all pure-python, no Isaac; 31 pytest tests green):**
- `pyproject.toml` (pure-python deps only), package tree + `__init__`s.
- `schema/pv_module.py` — fault taxonomy (§6.5), `PanelRecord`, `pv:` attr
  constants, append-only log, `local_to_geo`/`geo_to_local` georef.
  **pxr imported lazily inside the USD fns only** so the module imports Isaac-free.
- Interfaces: `perception/base.py` (Verdict/Diagnosis), `transport/base.py`
  (Pose + panel read/write), `control/base.py` (Waypoint).
- `perception/ground_truth.py` — the Slice 0 "cheat": reads `pv:state` from ctx.
- `orchestrator/mission.py` — the escalation FSM (ADVANCE→SCREEN→CONFIRM→
  WRITEBACK), returns structured `MissionResult` (injected-vs-detected, events).
- `orchestrator/fake_backend.py` — `FakeSimBackend` (Transport+RobotControl in
  RAM) for Isaac-free logic tests.
- `world/layout.py` — pure geometry + **seeded** fault injection; shared by
  `run.py` now and `farm_builder.py` later so sim & tests get identical panels.
- `configs/farm.yaml`, `configs/mission.yaml` (seeded, sim_native default).
- `run.py` — config → mission → `runs/<ts>/results.json`. `--backend fake`
  works now; `--backend sim_native` raises a clear NotImplemented (Spark half).
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` — platform + how-to-run + ROS 2 TODO.
- **Verified run:** `--backend fake` → 10 panels, 2 seeded faults, detection_rate
  1.00, run record emitted.

**Key finding:** `usd-core` has **no aarch64 wheel** → `pxr` only exists under
Isaac's Python on this box. Drove the lazy-pxr design in `pv_module.py`. See
`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`.

**Decisions:** sim-native is the only Transport until Day-1 ROS 2 check (user
confirmed ROS 2 status = not yet checked). Plain FSM (not py_trees). Fault
subset healthy/hotspot/soiled. 0-based row/col indices in panel IDs.

**Next (World half, on the Spark, in Bible §8 order):**
1. **Day 1-2:** ROS 2 camera-publish de-risk; record result + build details in
   `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` (the `[ ]` checklist there).
2. **Day 3-5:** `world/farm_builder.py` — build USD from `farm.yaml` reusing
   `world/layout.py`; stamp `PVModule` prims via `schema` USD fns; assert Z-up/
   meters; inject faults + emissive signature + semantics.
3. **Day 6-8:** `world/sim_runtime.py` + `transport/sim_native.py` (annotator/
   render-product camera reads + poses); kinematic `control/kinematic.py`.
4. Wire `sim_native` into `run._build_backend`; run the real mission on Spark.
5. `transport/ros2_bridge.py` per §6.3 (only depend on it once Day-1 passes).

**Not started:** everything World-half above; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/ROS2_CONTRACT.md`; git branch/commit (nothing committed yet this session).
